Github2jenkins 

Have config yaml which determines how the incoming GitHub request is mapped to a set of Jenkins jobs with with corresponding parameters

Rudimentary diffing can be done by looking at the files which have been modified

The idea is that there are multiple projects in a repo

jenkins-url: "something"
ci-dir: "ci"
projects:
  first-project:
    path: "./first"
    jobs:
      - branch: "master"
        pipeline: "deploy1.groovy"
        parameters: "some kind of expression"
        token: "A23FD37E"
      - branch: "*"
        pipeline: "deploy1.groovy"
        parameters: "other"
